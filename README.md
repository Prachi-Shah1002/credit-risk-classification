# Credit-risk-classification

# Before You Begin
1. Create a new repository for this project called credit-risk-classification. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.
2. Clone the new repository to your computer.
3. Inside your credit-risk-classification repository, create a folder titled "Credit_Risk."
4. Inside the "Credit_Risk" folder, add the credit_risk_classification.ipynb and lending_data.csv files found in the "Starter_Code.zip" file.
5. Push your changes to GitHub.

# Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
Open the starter code notebook and use it to complete the following steps:
1. Read the lending_data.csv data from the Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create the labels set (y) from the “loan_status” column, and then create the features (X) DataFrame from the remaining columns.
3. Split the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.
